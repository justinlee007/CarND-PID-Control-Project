# PID Controller Project
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This project implements a PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controller to use with the Udacity car simulator.  With the PID running, the car will autonomously drive around the track, adjusting the steering based on a given CTE (Cross Track Error) value.
